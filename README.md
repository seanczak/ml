## Structure

### nbdev environment note
I chose nbdev because it allows for me to walk through the logic and unit test my code within a jupyter environment.  If you are unfamiliar with nbdev I suggest you read into it because it has changed the way I code and think about data science coding environments. That being said, many of the files are simply structural to the nbdev environment and are not "my work." If I didn't write about it here, you can probably assume its an nbdev thing.  For example, the `docs/` functionality of nbdev are not used in this repo but nbdev does not build the library if I remove this directory. Thus, ignore this directory.

### Notebooks ---> .py modules

The modules I create with these notebooks will be stored in `ml/` while the notebooks to create them are stored in `utils_nbs/`. The py modules are auto-generated by the notebooks (nbdev is great) and thus the notebooks are the source of truth. The notebooks are written with a combination of code, markdown, comments, use-cases, visualizations which is much more powerful than the basic comments-functionality that py files allow.  Thus, read the notebooks if you're interested in why I've coded something a certain way or are looking to understand it.
